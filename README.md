### INSTAGRAM MAPS

This is a web app to explore Instagram on a map. Clicking anywhere on the map brings
recent Instagram posts in the region.

#### Privacy policy
This app runs on the Github Server as a static one page application. No visitor information
is collected by the app. The images are provided by the Instagram API, the map data is provided
by Google Maps. The app has no idea of the content of the images, so viewer discretion
is advised.
